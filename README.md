# KNN_Algorithm
Implement the Knn Algorithmto the titanic dataset with python

# Ex1 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier - Titanic

This exercise contains the Python script for the development and evaluation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier applied to the survival prediction problem using the Titanic dataset.

## ⚙️ Configuration and Execution

1.  **Update the CSV File Path:**
    Modify the path within your script so that it correctly points to the exact location of your `Titanic-Dataset.csv` file:

```python
# Modify the path here to your file location:
titanic_data = pd.read_csv('/your_path_to_the_file/Titanic-Dataset.csv', sep=',')
```
Be sure to have your python packages at least in this versions
